1. File "Tank-Still" is a resizing of the aa tank unit at rest to allow for animations without size change and should replace the existing unit if the animation is used.
2. Files "Tank-Move-1" and "Tank-Move-2" are initial cloud dust building and run at the start of the animation but do not cycle as the tank moves.
3. Files "Tank-Move-3" through "Tank-Move-6" cycle one after the other indefinitely once the vehicle is in motion until it stops.

These were quite tough to make work even in the limited way that you are seeing them. The big challenge is not being able to see them work.
I am also unsure of what we require for amount of frames for smooth running or how much detail is really required in each frame.
If you give me a way to drop the images in and test the flow and look I will give you many more animations at a quicker pace. For now lets use these to test the animations.
