Fuck, I am dead.
I finished this up a few hours ago but forgot to upload. I was having so much fun with icons and watching old movies I ate a few caffeine pills and just kept working.
I'll see about sending some of those out to you tomorrow evening or when I wake up.

As for this audio stuff everything is mixed by me from free shit on the internet. They are unpolished and are more going for an idea.
Most of the stuff I made is pointless and I am thinking of tones for buildings in the notifications style with slight variations based on building class. But you have some shit to pop in and play with.
I suggest you use the "pop" for finger release alert, for the effect of "yeah you just did that."

I'm off to sleep man hope you have a good one.
