For The Love Of Power
===========

The repo for the best game ever being worked on by absurdomatic games during this game's development cycle.

### Now A Public Repo!

#### Why?

Because we stopped working on FTLoP years ago. This used to be our working, private, repo but it isn't doing anyone any good just gathering dust so this seemed like a great opportunity to showcase my hard work on what was a fun and challenging project.

#### What?

FTLoP was a mobile real time strategy game, of the 4X variety, that would pit human opponents against each other in fast, intense multiplayer matchups. My brother and I worked on the game, though the programming was entirely my domain, and we learned so very much about game development that I feel like someone will, hopefully, benefit from our experience. 

I intend to make a full blogpost, going into further detail on the topics that this project covers but here's a quick overview of what you can find here:

 * Grids
   * Unit Grouping
   * Unit Movement
 * Organization
   * Inheritance/Polymorphism
   * Game State
 * Object Pooling
 * Multiplayer
 * Dynamic Spline Manipulation
 
Note: I am incredibly proud of my work, though I recognize that some parts of the code (specifically some of the movement stuff) requires refactoring. I was unable to address this before we stopped working on the project. I may still return to refactor this stuff in the future, maybe I'll even get an interesting blog post out of it.

#### When?

Thursday September 5th 2019

#### Who?

I, Bryan Gromadzki, have decided that this repo should be public.

#### Where?

Right here on github! And maybe eventually on the Gizmondo, I've bet some big money on that thing making a huge comeback.

### Thank you 

For checking out my project, I hope you are able to learn something from what was my most rewarding personal project to date. 
We were unable to finish the game as my brother and I slowly drifted apart and had to focus on our personal lives; though there's always hope that we'll get a chance to work on something together again in the future. 

Thought the issues area is still full of bugs/tasks from development, feel free to add new ones with any questions you may have or you can reach out to me at my email:
